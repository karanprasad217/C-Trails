c2.
c3. Write a C program for insertion of a node in Linked List (on the basis of some constraints). Assume :: Sorted Linked List. Make a node with user input and append accordingly.
c4.
c5. Write a C program for, given an array A your task is to tell at which position the equilibrium first occurs in the array. Equilibrium position in an array is a position such that the sum of elements below it is equal to the sum of elements after it.
c6. Write a C program for, given n non-negative integers in array representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
c7. Write a C program for, given an array of distinct elements, rearrange the elements of array in zig-zag fashion in O(n) time. The converted array should be in form a < b > c < d > e < f.The relative order of elements is same in the output i.e you have to iterate on the original array only.
